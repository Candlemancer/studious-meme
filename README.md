Repository for the Final Project of our Data Visualization (CS 5890) Course

[Website Link](https://candlemancer.github.io/studious-meme)

## Code Overview
This project consists of an html page, a css stylesheet, javascript files, a process book and affiliated images, and various stages of our data, from the initial webscraping to the final json file.

This project utilizes D3's library functions to help render the charts, though this is done by linking to an online source; the D3 library source code is not included in this project.

## Screencast
This project has embedded a screencast within the resulting webpage that demonstrates the basic functionality of the page.

## Process Book
Our initial planning is included in the process.md file, as well as notes made on design and development as the project developed.
